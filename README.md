Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a challenging condition that can significantly affect your ability to enjoy daily life. It often leads to persistent pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. When traditional treatments such as pain relievers or physical therapy are no longer effective, many patients look for other solutions to avoid surgery. One promising non-surgical option is the Euflexxa Injection service in Butler, available at Butler Medical Imaging.
In this article, we’ll explore what Euflexxa is, how it works, its dosage, side effects, and who should or should not consider this treatment.

What is Euflexxa?
Euflexxa is a type of viscosupplementation therapy specifically designed to relieve knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. It contains sodium hyaluronate, a purified form of hyaluronic acid (HA)—a naturally occurring substance found in the synovial fluid of healthy joints.
In osteoarthritis, the quality and quantity of this synovial fluid diminish, causing increased friction between the bones, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. Euflexxa helps by restoring the natural properties of joint fluid, improving lubrication, and cushioning the joint.
At Butler Medical Imaging, we specialise in offering Euflexxa Injection service in Butler to help patients manage knee pain and improve their daily function without the need for surgery.
Who is a Good Patient for Euflexxa Injection?
Euflexxa is often recommended for patients who:
✔ Experience ongoing knee pain due to osteoarthritis
✔ Have not responded well to traditional pain medications like NSAIDS (e.g., ibuprofen) or acetaminophen
✔ Want to delay or avoid invasive procedures such as knee replacement surgery
✔ Need enhanced joint mobility for everyday activities
Before starting treatment, our expert team at Butler Medical Imaging conducts a thorough assessment to ensure Euflexxa is a safe and appropriate option for each individual patient.
How Does Euflexxa Injection Work?
Euflexxa provides relief through a method called viscosupplementation. During this procedure, hyaluronic acid is injected directly into the knee joint.
Mechanism of Action:
✅ Lubricates the Joint: Euflexxa restores the natural thickness and slickness of the joint fluid, helping the bones glide smoothly over each other.
✅ Acts as a Shock Absorber: The enhanced fluid helps to cushion impacts during walking or other activities.
✅ Reduces Pain and Inflammation: By improving joint function, Euflexxa minimises the mechanical wear and tear that triggers pain and swelling.
While Euflexxa is currently approved in the United States for knee osteoarthritis only, it has been used in other parts of the world for treating other joints like the hip, shoulder, and ankle.
Contraindications: Who Should Avoid Euflexxa Injection?
Euflexxa is a safe option for many patients, but it’s not suitable for everyone. You should avoid Euflexxa injections if you:
❌ Have active skin infections at or near the injection site
❌ Are dealing with bacterial infections in or around the joint
❌ Have known allergies to hyaluronic acid products
❌ Have a blood clotting disorder or are taking anticoagulant medications
❌ Are pregnant or breastfeeding (since safety in these groups has not been established)
At Butler Medical Imaging, patient safety is our top priority. We perform careful screening to determine who will benefit most from the Euflexxa Injection service in Butler.
Euflexxa Injection Dosage
The typical dosage schedule for Euflexxa involves:
✔ 1 to 2mL (20mg/2mL) of sodium hyaluronate injected directly into the knee once a week
✔ A series of three injections over three consecutive weeks
In some cases, based on the patient's condition and response, up to five weekly injections may be given. Pain relief often becomes noticeable after the second or third injection and can last for up to six months or more.
For the best outcome, it’s important that patients complete the full course of injections as scheduled.
